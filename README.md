We took data from different sources, such as Wikipedia, Kaggle and ratings files, to create an ETL process in which we cleaned, restructured and shape to get the most information available for future decision-making takers. As well, we created functions that allow to clean and merge movie data columns. All of this work is uploaded to Postgre SQL and the material for our Hackton is ready
